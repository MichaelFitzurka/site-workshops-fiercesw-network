# Quick Start

Below at the bottom of the page you'll see a few drop downs with a **Student ID**, **Domain**, and **Workshop**.  Your instructor will give you directions on what to fill in these boxes.  Without doing so, you won't be able to proceed as the environment won't be provisioned and the instructions won't give the proper FQDNs along the way.
