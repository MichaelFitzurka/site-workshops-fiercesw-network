                <h3>What's going on?</h3>
                <p>Every user in Cloudbreak has their own Workspace - each workspace needs credentials for a cloud platform in order to provision clusters.  Upon login we're in our default workspace in our cluster which has no credentials or resources attached.</p>
                <p class="lead">Let's switch to the shared workshop workspace.</p>

		<p>CloudBreak supports multiple Workspaces that can be shared amongst users and groups.  Workspaces are a great way to logically separate different credentials, environments, resources, teams, and more.</p>
		<p>Upon login, each user is placed into their default workspace - in this case every user has a workspace named after themselves.</p>
		<p>For this workshop there is a shared workspace with a single large cluster that all the students will use.  The name will change based on what the workshop location, title, or theme is.</p>
		<p class="lead">In the upper right hand corner, click on the User/Workspace Dropdown and select the "workshop" Workspace.</p>

		<p>Now that we are in the proper workspace, we can see a cluster available and we no longer receive the "No Credentials" error.</p>
		<p>This is because the shared workspace has credentials and resources pre-provisioned by an administrator so as Data Scientists we don't have to worry about clouds, keys, or resources.</p>

		<p>Ambari features streaming actions and notifications, allows you to interact with your HDFS store, and features self-healing capabilities.</p>

		<p>Apache Zeppelin is a component of the Hortonworks cluster that allows you to run Data-driven workloads.</p>

		<p>These Paragraphs can have different <em>Interpreters</em> such as Markdown, Python, SQL, Spark, and more.</p>
		<p>Because these Notebooks are text-based, they can be checked into a version control system such as GitHub and easily shared and collaborated on.</p>
