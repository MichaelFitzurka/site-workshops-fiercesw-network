# Quick Start

Below you'll see a few drop downs with a **Student ID**, **Domain**, and **Workshop**.  Your instructor will give you directions on what to fill in these boxes.  Without doing so, you won't be able to proceed as the environment won't be provisioned and the instructions won't give the proper FQDNs along the way.
