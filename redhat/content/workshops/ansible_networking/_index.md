## Overview

This Ansible for Networking Workshop is meant for anyone who has had any exposure to Ansible, whether you have used it or not.  We are going to start with a short overview and then we'll get into the lab as soon as possible.  that is where we will spend most of our time.

## Your Responsibilities

 - **Have a Discussion**  - This will be boring if it's just us, up here talking for over 4 hours.
 - **Participate** - We are going to cut you loose with Ansible and some networking devices, in just a little while.  Have questions.  Have opinions.  Let us know if you have a way Ansible could be useful to you and we'll find a solution.
 - **Say "Hello" to your neighbor** - Don't be shy - these workshops are best when worked together.
 - **Ask for Help** - Got a problem?  Want extra eyes on something?  A potential bug?  We're all ears!
