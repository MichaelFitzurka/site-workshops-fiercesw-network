== How to access the workshop

Once you have your Environment & Seat configured, you can select one of the following methods to connect to the Ansible Control Node - the machine that we'll connect to and execute our Ansible automation upon the rest of the network it is a part of.

There are two ways of access the control node:

1. link:#connect-directly[Connect directly via an SSH Client]
2. link:#connect-via-wetty[Connect with the provided in-browser terminal, Wetty]

[#connect-directly]
=== Connect directly via an SSH Client

If you are using your own laptop, or are able to SSH via a Chrome extention such as the link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en[Secure Shell App] extension, then you can simply connect using your favorite SSH Client, such as link:https://www.putty.org/[Putty].

 - **Hostname** - {{< urifqdn_an >}}
 - **Username** - {{< student_seat "student" >}}
 - **Password** - Instructor supplied
 - **Connection Command** - ssh {{< student_seat "student" >}}@{{< urifqdn_an >}}

[#connect-via-wetty]

Use this URL to access the Wetty node, just change the workshop name (if applicable). Ask your instructor for the workshop name and domain.

``` text
